Simple-register-login-and-comment
=================================

I did this for a bit of practice, It's a simple registration, login and comment system.

It's tested and working with mySQL and PHP5

1.	Change the values in create_database.php, login.php, register.php and comments.php for mysqli_connect():
	##HOST##			= hostname (i.e. localhost, 127.0.0.1, example.com)
	##USERNAME##		= your mySQL username
	##PASSWORD##		= your mySQL password
	##DATABASE_NAME##	= the database you connect to

2.	Navigate to and open create_database.php in a browser. If it succeeds, delete the file.
	And that's it! You can add more HTML, CSS etc. as you need to suit it to your needs.
